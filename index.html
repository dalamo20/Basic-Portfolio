        <p> Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! A little about me: I love my coffee
          bold
          and strong to keep me up long hours,
          I enjoy taking on new challenges such as learning new programs and on my own time a new language,
          also a huge Game of Thrones fan.
        </p>

      <div id="p2">
        <p> Before I became a Web Developer I was actually studying for the MCAT and GRE. Crazy? Yes well unfortunately
          I
          got nowhere with both exams and continued to
          build my career in research at Northwestern University where I worked as a Research Study Coordinator at the
          time. Seeing that my career was at a halt I
          decided to use the schools resources and advance my career by attending a certificate program. Upon
          acceptance,
          my work schedule conflicted with the school schedule
          and I made the decision to quit my job and pursue a career that is always growing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="p3">
        <p> The 3 months was intense and I had no experience with coding or its terminology. The program built my
          confidence and gave me the inspiration to make extraordinary websites
          on my own and with passionate classmates. Though the program is short, it shows that I can learn new programs
          in a short period of time and utilize
          any library I have to work with. I am glad I took the chance to change my career and find continueing
          education
          a great way to challenge myself.
