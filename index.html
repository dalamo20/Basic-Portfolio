                Captains blog (pause)...coordinates...IN A CHAIR stuck on this homework! I managed to get an okay layout. Did not have the time to complete the assignment. The portfolio section needs work.

                Some text for fun.I quit my job because it's not web development and it was definitely not as cool. I like to do backflips when noone is looking
                so I can smirk in the back like I'm the coolest one in the room. Just between us, I say I'm going on break
                but I really just walk out to do a flip.
