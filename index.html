        <p> Thank you for visiting my portfolio! A little about me: I love my coffee
          black and bold just incase you are buying. I enjoy taking on new challenges such as learning new programs and
          on my own time I am currently attempting to learn Vietnamese.
          Also a huge fan of Game of Thrones, horror flicks and Marvel nerd. I recently made an Instagram to finally
          gain credit for the cool photos I take for my wife using the Canon 6. Is it weird to give my cat, Pusheen, a
          photoshoot?

        <p> Before I became a Web Developer I was actually studying for the MCAT and GRE. Crazy? Well unfortunately I
          didn't find myself going anywhere in the health field
          so I continued to
          build my career in research at Northwestern University where I worked as a Research Study Coordinator at the
          time. Seeing that my career was at a halt I
          decided to use the schools resources and learn a new skill in Web
          Development. My work schedule conflicted with the school hours
          so I made the decision to quit my job to pursue a career that promises growth over the years.

        <p> The 3 months of coding was intense and I had no experience with coding before. The program built my
          confidence and gave me the inspiration to make extraordinary websites
          on my own and with passionate classmates. Though the program was short, it shows that I can learn new
          programs
          in a short period of time and utilize
          any library I have to work with. It gave me the tools I need in order to build fully functional websites.
